        <p>
          Hi! I am Donna Virtudez, a third-year Computer Science student at
          Cavite State University â€“ Bacoor Campus. I have a strong passion for
          web development and I am excited to continue building my skills in
          this field. Throughout my studies, I have gained hands-on experience
          working with various programming languages and frameworks, and I have
          had the opportunity to collaborate on several group projects with my
          classmates, which has strengthened my teamwork and problem-solving
          abilities. As I continue my journey in Computer Science, I am eager to
          expand my knowledge and gain practical experience through internships
          or personal projects. I am always looking for ways to challenge myself
          and grow as a developer. When I am not coding, I enjoy watching
          movies, playing online games with friends, and occasionally reading
          books. These hobbies help me unwind and stay creative. I am always
          open to connecting with like-minded individuals, whether for
          collaboration, learning, or sharing knowledge.
